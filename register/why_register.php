<h1>Why do I need to register?</h1>

<p>Like many online services that enable anonymous public comments (e.g. PubPeer), Registered Reports Community Feedback requires users to register with an account.</p>

<p>Creating a user account allows users who are returning to give Stage 2 feedback on a specific manuscript, to link that Stage 2 feedback to existing Stage 1 feedback for the same manuscript.</p>

<p>For prospective feedback (e.g. feedback where Stage 2 peer review has yet to occur, and where the user has given Stage 1 feedback) a user account enables users to leave feedback per stage and link those stages.</p>

<p>A user account also allows for authors/reviewers of multiple manuscripts to manage/distinguish between the various pieces of feedback they have given.For instance, a user can view the Stage 1 feedback they have previously given, before giving linked Stage 2 feedback. A logged in user may also choose to invite co-authors to give feedback on the same manuscript (in the case of author feedback).</p>

<p>For these reasons you will need to register for an account to give feedback. We only require that you register a functioning email address (your name is not required) and the email address does not need to be one that identifies you by name.</p>
